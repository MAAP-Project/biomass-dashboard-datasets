  Japan, despite its high population density, is covered by almost two thirds of forest (about 25 million ha). About 40% of these are forest plantations (typically Japanese cedar and cypress) which often are located in areas of moderate to steep terrain (that are unsuitable for agriculture or large-scale human habitation). Remaining natural forests include both high biomass species such as oak and beech, as well as low biomass species such as bamboo.

  The large diversity of tree species, climate zones, and topographic conditions thus contribute to making Japan a suitable location for validation of existing and forthcoming satellite-based AGB maps.

  The total (above and below-ground) carbon stocks of Japanese forests have been estimated to between about 2700 and 3020 million (M) tonnes around 2011 (Egusa et al., Scientific Reports, 10, 7895, 2020). This estimate was based on National Forest Inventory (NFI) ground survey data (including stem volume, species and age), with total biomass estimated using parameters such as biomass expansion factor, wood density, and Japanese total forest area.

  The validation effort is coordinated and undertaken by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), using the "plot2map" validation tool available on the Multi-Mission Algorithm and Analysis Platform (MAAP). Ground-based inventory data have been obtained from the National Forest Agency NFI, the "Monitoring Site 1000" project data of the Ministry of Environment, and SYNRA, a university forest research network. As the characteristics of each of the three data collections varies (e.g., in relation to plot sizes, geolocation accuracy and measurement methods), validation approaches need to be adapted accordingly but allow independent estimates of uncertainty to be provided.

<p>
  As part of the biomass harmonization collaboration, JAXA provides the global ALOS (for the time period 2007-2010) and ALOS-2 (2015-present) radar imagery that constitute the key input data for the CCI Biomass, JPL, and NCEO Africa biomass products.

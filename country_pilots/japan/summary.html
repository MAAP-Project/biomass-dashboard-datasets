<p>
  Japan, despite its high population density, is covered by almost two thirds of forest. These are dominated by forest
  plantations (typically Japanese cedar and cypress) which often are located in areas of moderate to steep terrain (that
  are unsuitable for agriculture or large-scale human habitation). Remaining natural forests include high biomass
  species
  such as oak and beech, as well as low biomass species such as bamboo.

<p>
  The large diversity of tree species, climate zones, and topographic conditions thus contribute to making Japan a
  suitable location for validation of existing and forthcoming satellite-based AGB maps.
</p>

<p>
  The validation effort is coordinated and undertaken by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), using the
  so-called “plot2map” validation tool on the Multi-Mission Algorithm and Analysis Platform (MAAP). Ground-based
  inventory
  data have been obtained from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) of the National Forest Agency, the Ministry of
  Environment and SYNRA, a university forest research network. As the characteristics of each of the three data
  collections varies (e.g., in relation to plot sizes, geolocation accuracy and measurement methods), validation
  approaches need to be adapted accordingly but allow independent estimates of uncertainty to be provided.

  Paraguay is a landlocked South American country that contains vast forest ecosystems. The Gran Chaco covers over 60
  percent of Paraguay’s land and is South America’s second largest forest after the Amazon. The carbon stored in
  Paraguay’s forests was measured as part of the national REDD+ program, when the first national forest inventory (NFI)
  was deployed from 2014 to 2016. Paraguay is now seeking to update the NFI and expand to regions that were unreachable
  in
  the original survey.
  Remote sensing data offers an attractive alternative to field surveys since it is freely accessible, spatially
  explicit,
  and can be used to measure forest characteristics in areas that are inaccessible. A collaborative team involving
  members
  of Paraguay’s Instituto Forestal Nacional, USGS SilvaCarbon, the CEOS Biomass Harmonization group, and US Forest
  Service
  is exploring a remote sensing approach to update and supplement national biomass estimation.

  measurements from NASA’s GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) lidar instrument, which is mounted on the

  Our national estimate of biomass is 66.01 Mg per hectare (± ## 95% confidence interval), which is consistent with the
  69.89 Mg/ha value reported by Paraguay to the FAO in 2020. Our generalizable approach can be applied anywhere with
  forests and GEDI observations.

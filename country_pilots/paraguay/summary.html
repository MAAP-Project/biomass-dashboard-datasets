<p>Paraguay is a landlocked South American country that is divided by the Río Paraguay into two distinct geographic
    regions. The east (Paraguay Oriental) contains humid Atlantic, Chaco, and Cerrado forests, while the west (Paraguay
    Occidental) is primarily dry and humid Chaco. The Gran Chaco covers over 60 percent of Paraguay’s land and is South
    America’s second largest forest after the Amazon. In 2014 and 2015 Paraguay deployed their first national forest
    inventory (NFI) as part of their REDD+ program. Paraguay is now seeking to update their NFI and expand to regions
    that
    were unable to be surveyed due to inaccessibility in the vast forests.

<p>Remote sensing data offers an attractive alternative to field surveys since it is freely accessible, spatially
    explicit,
    and can be used to model forest characteristics such as aboveground biomass. A collaborative team involving members
    of
    Paraguay’s National Forestry Institute, USGS SilvaCarbon, the CEOS Harmonization group, and US Forest Service is
    exploring a remote sensing approach to national biomass estimation. The approach integrates Paraguay’s NFI with GEDI
    LiDAR data and a Landsat canopy cover model to create a statistically viable estimate for Paraguay’s mean forest
    biomass. Importantly, the model can quantify uncertainties and be used to calculate a confidence interval around the
    estimate of mean biomass.

<p>
    Biomass is estimated with a model that relates field measurements to remote sensing data. NFI data is matched to
    spatially overlapping GEDI waveforms to form a model building dataset, and all plots without colocated GEDI shot are
    excluded.

<p>
    A map of percent canopy cover is also used in the biomass model, which we created for 2019 in order to be consistent
    with the first GEDI observations.

    A regression model is used to predict field biomass using the LiDAR and canopy cover data.

<p>
    The model can then be applied to all GEDI footprints in the country to create a national estimate of biomass and
    uncertainty. The national estimate can also be decomposed to subdomains, such as by forest types or within 6 km
    tiles.

<p>
    Our national estimate of biomass is 66.01 Mg per hectare (± ## 95% confidence interval), which is with the 69.89
    Mg/ha
    reported by Paraguay to the FAO in 2020. Our generalizable approach can be applied anywhere with forests and GEDI
    observations. The field data used for model calibration does not need to be randomly distributed, making it suitable
    for
    countries without a well-established forest inventory.

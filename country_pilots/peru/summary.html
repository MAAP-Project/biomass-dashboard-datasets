    While Peru’s network of forest inventories is key for defining national forest policies and management strategies, there is a need to include additional spatially-explicit biomass and biomass change information that could contribute to more comprehensive and continuous biomass information for LULUCF GHG monitoring and reporting. Peru relies on a probabilistic, though incomplete, sample of plots from the National Forest &amp; Wildlife Inventory (NF&amp;WI) for estimating national forest-related emission factors. Hence, while the NF&amp;WI is still incomplete, Peru is interested to benefit from the use of remote sensing-based biomass products to enhance the accuracy of national and subnational AGB estimates. At the same time, in the latest update of the FREL, the country also recognized the need to better account and propagate the sources of uncertainties within its LULUCF-GHG accountability system.

    A dedicated demonstration study was implemented together with SERFOR (the Peruvian agency conducting the NFI efforts), and Wageningen University and partners (Málaga et al., in prep). At the Peruvian Amazonia level the study explored how global biomass maps (e.g. CCI Biomass 2017 map) in combination with ground based data contribute to enhance national AGB estimates, for instance, by defining more efficient national sampling efforts for GHG LULUCF monitoring and reporting. The work is complemented by the INFFS team in collaboration with USGS Silvacarbon looking into calibrating the global Biomass maps for all the ecozones of Peru, using the data as a basis the field plots to obtain a spatially explicit biomass map for all the ecozones of Peru.

    The study statistically assessed whether the use of a global biomass map as an auxiliary source of information resulted in a gain in precision of AGB estimates in the Peruvian Amazonia. Two-stage model-assisted estimators were used accommodating for the country NFI sampling design, and explored hybrid inferential techniques to additionally account for the sources of uncertainty resulting from the integration of the remote sensing products with the NFI data. The demonstration case resulted in three main findings:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Without correcting for the map systematic error, the 2017 CCI biomass map tended to consistently overestimate forest-related AGB values across the Peruvian Amazon, revealing that there is still room for improvement in future map updates.
    </li>
    <li>
        Accounting for the sources of uncertainties from the integration of the biomass map and the NF&amp;WI data conveyed in a more comprehensive error assessment exercise, prompted by the IPCC good practice guidelines. In the study, the largest contribution came from the within polygon variability, related to the effect of the reference data being of smaller size than the remote sensing-based sampling units. Subsequently, the measurement error was the second contributor to the total variability; whereas the positional error was found negligible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the map as auxiliary source of information to the NF&amp;WI reference data progressively enhanced the precision of our forest-related stratum-wise and Peruvian Amazonia AGB model-assisted estimates. Whereas the uncorrelated version of the map resulted in a marginal benefit; after calibration, the global biomass map proved a substantial contribution to the AGB estimates, even when propagating the sources of uncertainty mentioned above. 
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    In conclusion, even when propagating uncertainties, the precision of the estimates was enhanced up to 90% and 60% at the stratum and Amazon level, respectively.  Thus, the use of a global biomass map did improve the precision and a better consideration of uncertainties for Peru’s national forest monitoring and GHG inventory estimation.

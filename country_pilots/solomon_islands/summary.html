  The Solomon Islands comprises a scattered archipelago of 994 islands combining mountainous islands
  and a land area of 28,896 km<sup>2</sup>. The implementation of a National Forest Inventory
  remains challenging but the Solomon Islands is committed to carry out its GHG inventories and
  develop its measurement and monitoring capacity.

  In 2019, the first Forest Reference Emission Level was submitted to the UNFCCC using IPCC biomass
  default estimates to derive Emission Factors for deforested areas. The national REDD+ team is now
  starting to explore the opportunities arising from the increasing availability of biomass products
  derived from satellite data. The objective is to explore the utility of these maps to derive
  estimates of forest above-ground biomass that are potentially more accurate and more representative
  of the national forests than the IPCC defaults, while at the same time developing feedback to
  global biomass monitoring experts to improve their products.

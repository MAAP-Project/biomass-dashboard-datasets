  The native forests of Wales are primarily broadleaved, occur mainly in the lowlands, and include unique and rare
  Atlantic temperate rainforests. The vast majority of coniferous forests have been planted, are common in the
  uplands and some coastal regions, and generally support the greatest amounts of biomass on a per hectare basis.

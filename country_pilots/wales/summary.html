The native forests of Wales are primarily broadleaved, occur mainly at lower altitudes, and include unique and rare
Atlantic temperate rainforests. The vast majority of forest plantations are comprised of non-native coniferous species,
located in the uplands and some coastal regions, and generally support the greatest amounts of biomass on a per hectare
basis.

The total (above and below-ground) carbon stocks of Wales’s forests has been estimated as 22.1 million (M) tonnes,
broadly split equally between conifers (11.5 M tonnes) and broadleaves (10.6 M tonnes; as at 31st March 2011). This
estimate was based on maps of forest extent by type and informed by National Forest Inventory (NFI) ground survey data
(including species and age), with total biomass determined using allometric equations relating tree size to volume and
wood density values.

<p>
For Wales, extracts of the global above ground biomass (AGB) maps provide new information on the spatial distribution of
carbon in forests and other woody vegetation. These extents have been included in Living Wales’ annual national land
cover maps (<a href="https://wales.livingearth.online/">wales.livingearth.online</a> and available on the MAAP) that have been these constructed from environmental
descriptors (e.g, leaf type, canopy cover, selected dominant species) retrieved from satellite data.
</p>

<p>
The plot2map tool available within the NASA-ESA MAAP has given a unique opportunity for Forest Research scientists to
evaluate which of the global maps provided the most robust estimates of forest AGBs for Wales without releasing their
NFI fieldwork data (1700 1 ha squares in total).
</p>

<p>
Two of these NFI squares have been located in forests near the <a href="https://cat.org.uk">Centre for Alternative Technology</a>, which
also hosts the Living Wales Exhibition and Training Centre (with Aberystwyth University). Within these 1 ha squaress,
detailed measurements of trees are being undertaken according to the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS)
Biomass Land Product Validation (LPV) Biomass Protocol 
(<a href="https://lpvs.gsfc.nasa.gov/PDF/CEOS_WGCV_LPV_Biomass_Protocol_2021_V1.0.pdf">CEOS biomass cal/val protocol</a>), 
with these contributing to the
global network of high quality biomass plots required for future development and validation of EO-focused biomass
retrieval algorithms.

  "info": "The uncertainty map in the AGB 2020 product was produced using quantile regression to calculate the lower- and upper-bound of the estimation for each pixel, such that the 2.5-percentile and 97.5-percentile of the AGB estimation were predicted. The error map was produced by assuming that the error distribution is Gaussian. Therefore 95% of the predictions are approximately Â±2 SD."

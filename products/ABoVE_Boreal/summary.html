  <a href="https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/">NASA’s ICESat-2</a> is a photon counting lidar instrument that launched in 2018, and is collecting global 3D structure
  measurements of Earth’s terrain and vegetation. This provisional (still in development) product uses samples from
  <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/atl08">ICESat-2’s vegetation height product</a> in combination with 30 m data from <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-8?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con">NASA/USGS Landsat 8</a>, and the <a href="https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/explore-more/news-archive/-/asset_publisher/Ye8egYeRPLEs/blog/id/434960">Copernicus DEM</a>.
  This product focuses on high latitude boreal forests where NASA’s <a href="https://gedi.umd.edu/">GEDI</a> instrument doesn’t collect data, and is meant to
  complement the temperate and tropical forest maps from GEDI. The Arctic and Boreal regions are warming faster than
  anywhere on the planet, and high resolution forest carbon products like this help us understand how much carbon is
  currently stored in these ecosystems, and how it may change in the future. This research is funded by NASA’s <a href="https://above.nasa.gov/index.html">Arctic
  Boreal Vulnerability Experiment</a> and the ICESat-2 Science Team. For more information on how this product was made, click
  <a href="https://ceos.org/gst/icesat2-boreal-biomass.html">HERE</a>. This is a provisional product and is still being refined, and a final version will be accessible through NASA’s
  ORNL DAAC. Want to help us make this product better? Please let us know where it’s working well and where it can be
  improved by giving us feedback.

  ESA's <a href="https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/biomass/">Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Biomass project</a> has, in close collaboration with JAXA, produced maps of the Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) of woody vegetation at 100m resolution for 4 epochs: 2010, 2017, 2018 and 2020, with plans to increase this to annual products from 2016-2022, plus a 2005/2007 product. Requirements on global coverage during each of the four epochs, open access to the data and sensitivity of the observations to forest structural parameters restricted the useful pool of remote sensing observations to images acquired by the Japanese (JAXA) L-band radar sensors (ALOS PALSAR for 2010 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 for 2017-2018 and 2020) and the European C-band radar (Envisat ASAR for 2010 and Copernicus Sentinel-1 for 2017-2018 and 2020).

<p>Validation of the map products used a dedicated tool (plot2map) that allowed comparison with an extensive dataset of ground-based tree size measurements collected from small (averaging 0.15 ha; n > 70,549) and medium (0.9 - 3 ha; n > 462) to large-sized (> 6 ha; n > 20) research plots (Tiers 1-3 respectively), with adjustments made for temporal discrepancies and partial forest fractions.</p>

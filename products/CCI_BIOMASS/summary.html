<p>The primary science objective ESA’s Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Biomass project is to provide global maps of above-ground biomass (Mg ha-1) for four epochs (mid 1990s, 2010, 2017 and 2018), with these being capable of supporting quantification of biomass change. </p>
<p>The mapping will be at 1km grid spacing with a target relative error of less than 20 % where AGB exceeds 50 Mg ha-1. Although this resolution is finer than required for current climate modelling, it will allow more refined information to be inferred (e.g. forest age structure and the disturbance regime) that is relevant for climate and has the potential to be exploited by carbon cycle and climate models as they develop.</p>
<p>In this context, AGB is here referred to in terms of density (i.e., the amount of living biomass per unit area). Accordingly, AGB is expressed in units of mass of dry matter per unit ground area (i.e., Megagrams per hectare; Mg/ha-1).</p>

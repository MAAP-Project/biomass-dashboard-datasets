  NASA’s GEDI mission is a full waveform lidar instrument aboard the ISS. It launched in December 2018 and has been
  collecting 3D Earth surface and vegetation samples of temperate and tropical forests since April, 2019. GEDI is the
  first satellite lidar ever designed specifically to measure vegetation structure and biomass, filling a critical data
  gap. It shoots lasers that each illuminate ~25 m on the ground, and measures tree heights and volumes within those 25 m
  areas. GEDI estimates biomass by relating lidar measurements to estimates of biomass collecting in forest plots all over
  the world. The more field plots are available in an area, the better the GEDI maps will be. GEDI’s biomass map is at a 1
  km resolution, which aggregates all the 25 m samples in each 1 km cell. GEDI data are also inputs to other products,
  such as the CCI biomass 2020 product also shown on this dashboard. GEDI has collected >5 billion samples so far.

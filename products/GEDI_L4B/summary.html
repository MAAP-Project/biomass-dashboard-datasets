  NASA’s <a href="https://gedi.umd.edu/">GEDI</a> mission is a full waveform lidar instrument aboard the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html">ISS</a>. It launched in December 2018 and has been collecting 3D Earth surface and vegetation samples of temperate and tropical forests since April, 2019. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666017220300018">GEDI is the first satellite lidar specifically to measure vegetation structure</a> biomass, filling a critical data gap. It fires lasers that each illuminate ~25 m on the ground, and measures tree heights and volumes within those 25 m areas. <a href="https://daac.ornl.gov/GEDI/guides/GEDI_L4A_AGB_Density.html">GEDI estimates biomass</a> by relating lidar measurements to biomass collected in forest plots across the globe. The more field plots that are available within an area, the better the GEDI maps will be.<br>
  This Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L4B product provides 1 km x 1 km (1 km, hereafter) estimates of mean aboveground biomass density (AGBD) based on observations from mission week 19 starting on 2019-04-18 to mission week 138 ending on 2021-08-04. The GEDI L4A Footprint Biomass product converts each high-quality waveform to an AGBD prediction, and the L4B product uses the sample present within the borders of each 1 km cell to statistically infer mean AGBD. The gridding procedure is described in the GEDI L4B Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD). Patterson et al. (2019) describes the hybrid model-based mode of inference used in the L4B product. Corresponding 1 km estimates of the standard error of the mean are also provided in the L4B product. Uncertainty is due to both GEDI's sampling of the 1 km area (as opposed to making wall-to-wall observations) and the fact that L4A biomass values are modeled in a process subject to error instead of measured in a process that may be assumed to be error-free.<br>

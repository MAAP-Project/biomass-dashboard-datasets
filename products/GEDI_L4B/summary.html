  NASA’s <a href="https://gedi.umd.edu/">GEDI</a> mission is a full waveform lidar instrument aboard the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html">ISS</a>. It launched in December 2018 and has been collecting 3D Earth surface and vegetation samples of temperate and tropical forests since April, 2019. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666017220300018">GEDI is the first satellite lidar specifically to measure vegetation structure</a> biomass, filling a critical data gap. It fires lasers that each illuminate ~25 m on the ground, and measures tree heights and volumes within those 25 m areas. <a href="https://daac.ornl.gov/GEDI/guides/GEDI_L4A_AGB_Density.html">GEDI estimates biomass</a> by relating lidar measurements to biomass collected in forest plots across the globe. The more field plots that are available within an area, the better the GEDI maps will be. GEDI’s baseline biomass map is at a 1 km resolution, which aggregates all the 25 m samples in each 1 km cell and includes explicit estimates of error for each cell GEDI data are also inputs to other products, such as the CCI biomass 2020 product shown on this dashboard. GEDI has collected >10 billion samples so far.

  GEDI’s biomass product will be available in this dashboard soon!

  The JPL 2020 map is the global aboveground biomass (AGB) density estimates (unit: Mg/ha) derived from a combination of Landsat-8 composites, ALOS PALSAR backscatter (2019-2020) data and SRTM DEM at 100m spatial resolution, trained with samples from the spaceborne lidar data of ICESAT-1, airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, and field inventory data. We applied the boosting tree machine learning model to predict wall-to-wall AGB inferred from satellite data.

  This dataset (global above ground biomass density in Mg/ha) shows the distribution of vegetation above ground live
  biomass (AGB) at 100 m (1-ha) spatial resolution. The map is developed using a large dataset within a machine learning
  algorithm including forest inventory data, air and spaceborne samples of Lidar waveforms, and satellite imagery from
  ALOS PALSAR (circa 2020), SRTM, Landsat (circa 2020).

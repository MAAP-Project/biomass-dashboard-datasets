<p>The <a href="https://ceos.org/observations/gst/africa-biomass.html">NCEO Africa Aboveground Woody Biomass (AGB)</a> map for the year 2017 at 100 m spatial resolution was developed using a combination of LiDAR, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical based data. This product was developed by the UKâ€™s National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO) through the Carbon Cycle and Official Development Assistance (ODA) programmes. </p>
<p>The dataset consists of two files: i) Aboveground woody biomass raster, and ii) Uncertainty characterization raster. Both with a spatial resolution of 100 m. Aboveground woody biomass (AGB) is expressed as dry matter in Mg ha-1. Users should keep in mind that the map is a continental-scale dataset, which has been generated combining different types of data with a single method for the whole study area. Therefore, accuracy may vary for different regions and vegetation types.</p>

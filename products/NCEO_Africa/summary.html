  The NCEO Africa Aboveground Woody Biomass (AGB) map for the year 2017 at 100 m spatial resolution was developed
  using
  the NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (<a href="https://gedi.umd.edu/">GEDI</a>), JAXA’s L-band SAR
  <a href="https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/palsar_fnf/fnf_index.htm">ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 mosaics</a> and Landsat Percent
  Tree Cover (PTC) (<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1244693">Hansen et al., 2012</a>).
  This product is part of a time series of AGB maps (2007-2017) developed by the
  UK’s NERC <a href="https://www.nceo.ac.uk/">National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO)</a> through the Carbon
  Cycle and Official Development Assistance
  (ODA) programmes. This preliminary version of the 2017 map is available <a
    href="https://leicester.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Africa_Aboveground_Biomass_map_for_2017/15060270">here</a>.
  The final version of the AGB time
  series
  (2007-2017) will be available at the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (<a
    href="https://archive.ceda.ac.uk/">CEDA</a>).
